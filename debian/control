Description: An OpenRTM-aist-based robot controller.
 This package is the most tailored for humanoid (dual-arm and/or biped) robots for historical reason. hrpsys package does not only wraps but build and installs the code from its mainstream repository (github.com/fkanehiro/hrpsys-base). The package version number is synchronized to that of mainstream, based on this decision. Its semantics: MAJOR: Synchronized with OpenHRP3 MINOR: Indicate IDL compatibility (packages with different version numbers in this section are NOT compatible) PATCH: Packages with different version numbers in this section ARE compatible. API document is auto-generated on github.
